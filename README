Description:

	The File calc_wk_no.dbl contains a function called calc_wk_no.
This function will accept a calendar date as a parameter.  The function
will calculate the week number that contains that date.  The function
will return the 4-digit year associated with that week's Monday and the week
number that was calculated.  In addition the function will adjust the date
given to reflect the date associated with that week's Monday.  It may be
tested by sending it a date of December 31, 1998.  1998 was a year that
contained 53 weeks.

Behavior of the Code:

	Function will return a value of zero if no errors were found.
The function will return a non zero value if either the date given
is invalid or if the function did not receive a date in the proper
parameter.
